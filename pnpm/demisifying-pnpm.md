# Demistifying pnpm

## Agenda

Things we'll talk about today

- What is pnpm?
- Why was it created?
- What makes pnpm great?
- Q&A

---

# What is pnpm

- An open source package manager for the javascript ecosystem
- `p`erformant `npm`
- Written in TypeScript
- Other tools in this space
  - `npm` ( GitHub i.e. Microsoft)
  - `yarn` ( Facebook)
  - `bower` ( Twitter)

I asked GitHub Copilot who maintains pnpm and it said:

```

# Why do we have pnpm?

Before we talk about why `pnpm` is good, we first need to talk about the problems it set out to solve.

## Key terminology

### `package.json`:

  - A "manifest" file for a project
  - Specifies any metadata about the project (like it's name or it's version)
  - It also specifies any dependencies a project may have.

### `package-lock.json`:

  - Specific to the `npm` ecosystem, but it's role is common and many other tools have an equivalent.
  - Is automatically generated by the tool you're using to describe the _exact_ tree of dependencies that was generated/installed
  - `pnpm` generates a lock file is saved as `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### `node_modules/`: 

  - Directory where package managers install a project's dependencies
  - The directory structure is important and affects how `import` or `require` statements work

---

# Why do we have pnpm?

One common complaint when using `npm` is that `node_modules` are huge and take a while to install

## npm please

- Each `npm` project installs its own version of its dependencies
- Everytime you run `npm ci` every single dependency is fetched and unpacked
- `npm install`; nothing happens if nothing changed but deps might get updated
  - you can prevent it from changing the lockfile with `--no-save`
- If a dependency has its own set of dependencies, your project has access to them

## pnpm?

- Each `pnpm` project shares dependencies in a global store
- `pnpm install` nothing happens if nothing changed but can prevent deps from getting updated
  - using the flag `--frozen-lockfile`
  - if something did change, it will only install what changed (like, really)
- Your project only has access to deps in package.json, no transitive dependencies
  - unless you tell `pnpm` to expose them

---

# What makes pnpm great?

## npm `node_modules/`

- `npm` creates a "flat" node_modules structure
- Every dependency and transitive dependency is just installed right here

The structure of `node_modules` with `@socialtables/st-scripts` as the only dependency:
```bash
➜ tree npm_flat/node_modules -L 1 -a | head -n 15

npm_flat/node_modules
├── .bin
├── .package-lock.json

├── @istanbuljs
├── @jest
├── @jridgewell
├── @nicolo-ribaudo
├── ... about 560 more directories below
```

# What makes pnpm great?

## pnpm `node_modules/`

- **Hard links** dependencies in here from the files in the global store into `/.pnpm`
- Stores and sorts them based on the version of the package installed
- **Symlinks** directories from `/.pnpm` to the root of node_modules (controlling what you have access to)

The structure of `node_modules` with `@socialtables/st-scripts` as the only dependency:

```bash
➜ tree pnpm_nonflat/node_modules -L 1 -a | head -n 15

pnpm_nonflat/node_modules

# How does the file system work? (Unix-like FS, who uses Windows anymore)

## Key terminology

### Files

- Container in a computer for storing information
- When you create a file, an `inode` is created to hold metadata
- The file name is stored in a directory and `inodes` act as the "middleman" for the content

### Index Nodes

- A data structure that stores information about the file
- Contains attributes like size, permissions, timestamps
- It also contains the address of the data blocks in memory where the file content is stored

### Symbolic Link (or symlink)

- Is a pointer to another file on disk (e.g. "shortcuts" in Windows)
- It's a separate file with it's own `inode` that redirects to the original `inode`
- The actual content of a symlink is just a path that tells the file system where to find the original

### Hard Link

- Creates a new "label" for the original `inode`
- Both the original file and the hard link point to the same `inode`
- Changes made to the original file's content reflect in the hard link
- If the original file is renamed, deleted or moved the hard link is unchanged

## Content Addressable Store

- When you install a new version of a dependency, only the changed files are stored in the store
- Files that have not changed are reused
- All pnpm projects on the same machine look up dependencies from this same store
- A dependency is only ever really installed once

Example of content:

```bash
➜ cat v3/files/09/f48a6b2304e659cf84101be90030b443137260...'long hash continues'

import buildFormatLongFn from "../../../_lib/buildFormatLongFn/index.js";
var dateFormats = {

  long: 'd. MMMM yyyy',

## Symlinked node_modules structure

Scenario: you installed `foo@1.0.0` and foo depends on `bar@1.0.0`

### Phase 1 - Grab files from store
```plaintext
node_modules
└── .pnpm
    ├── bar@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       └── bar -> <store>/bar
    │           ├── index.js
    │           └── package.json
    └── foo@1.0.0
        └── node_modules
            └── foo -> <store>/foo
                ├── index.js
                └── package.json
```

## Symlinked node_modules structure

Scenario: you installed `foo@1.0.0` and foo depends on `bar@1.0.0`

### Phase 2 - Link transitive dependencies together

```plaintext
node_modules
└── .pnpm
    ├── bar@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       └── bar -> <store>/bar
    └── foo@1.0.0
        └── node_modules
            ├── foo -> <store>/foo
            └── bar -> ../../bar@1.0.0/node_modules/bar
```

## Symlinked node_modules structure

Scenario: you installed `foo@1.0.0` and foo depends on `bar@1.0.0`

### Phase 3 - Link direct dependencies

```plaintext
node_modules
├── foo -> ./.pnpm/foo@1.0.0/node_modules/foo
└── .pnpm
    ├── bar@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       └── bar -> <store>/bar
    └── foo@1.0.0
        └── node_modules
            ├── foo -> <store>/foo
            └── bar -> ../../bar@1.0.0/node_modules/bar
```

Scenario: you installed `foo@1.0.0` and foo depends on `bar@1.0.0`

### Curve Ball - Adding a new transitive dependency

Let's add `qar@2.0.0` as a dependency of BOTH foo and bar. So `foo > bar > qar` and `foo > qar`

```plaintext
node_modules
├── foo -> ./.pnpm/foo@1.0.0/node_modules/foo
└── .pnpm
    ├── bar@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── bar -> <store>/bar
    │       └── qar -> ../../qar@2.0.0/node_modules/qar
    ├── foo@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── foo -> <store>/foo
    │       ├── bar -> ../../bar@1.0.0/node_modules/bar
    │       └── qar -> ../../qar@2.0.0/node_modules/qar
    └── qar@2.0.0
        └── node_modules
            └── qar -> <store>/qar
```
